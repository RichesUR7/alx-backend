 # 0x01. Caching

## Description

This directory contains project files and resources for the "0x01. Caching" module of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum. The objective of this module is to explore and implement various caching mechanisms to optimize data retrieval processes, enhance application performance, and reduce latency.

## Objectives

- Understand the concept and importance of caching in software engineering.
- Learn different caching strategies and their use cases.
- Implement caching techniques in Python.
- Optimize applications using caching mechanisms.

## Contents

- Task Files: Source code and scripts for various caching tasks and exercises.
- README.md: Documentation and instructions for the module.
- Tests: Unit tests to verify the correctness and efficiency of caching implementations.

## Tasks

1. Basic Caching: Introduction to caching with simple examples.
2. LRU Caching: Implementing Least Recently Used (LRU) caching strategy.
3. LFU Caching: Implementing Least Frequently Used (LFU) caching strategy.
4. MRU Caching: Implementing Most Recently Used (MRU) caching strategy.
5. TTL Caching: Implementing Time-to-Live (TTL) caching mechanism.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Knowledge of data structures and algorithms
- Familiarity with Python's standard libraries

## Usage

To run the caching examples and tests, navigate to the appropriate task directory and execute the Python scripts. Ensure that all dependencies are installed.
                  $ python3 task_name.py

## Resources

- Python Official Documentation
- Caching Strategies
