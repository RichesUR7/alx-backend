# 0x03. Queuing System in JavaScript

This project is an integral part of the Back-end curriculum, designed to enhance understanding and practical skills in queuing systems using JavaScript. The primary aim is to implement a robust queuing system leveraging Redis, Node.js, Express.js, and Kue.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will:

- **Understand Queuing Systems**: Gain insights into what a queuing system is, its role in back-end development, and its significance for application performance and reliability.
- **Setup Redis**: Learn how to install and run a Redis server on your local machine.
- **Redis Client Operations**: Acquire skills to perform basic operations using the Redis client, including connecting to the server and executing commands.
- **Data Storage in Redis**: Understand how to store and manage hash values within Redis.
- **Async Operations**: Learn to handle asynchronous operations with Redis to ensure efficient data processing and retrieval.
- **Kue for Queuing**: Explore how to utilize Kue, a priority job queue, to manage tasks and background jobs effectively.
- **Express.js Integration**: Build a basic Express application that interacts with Redis, handling both data storage and queuing tasks.
- **Queue Management**: Develop an Express app that integrates with Redis and Kue to manage and process queued jobs.
- **System Benefits**: Recognize the performance improvements and enhanced user experience achieved by employing a queuing system.
- **Error Handling**: Learn strategies for managing errors and exceptions in a queuing system to maintain application stability and reliability.
