 # 0x02. i18n

This directory contains internationalization (i18n) resources and configurations for multi-language support in software projects. Internationalization is crucial for ensuring your software can adapt to different languages and cultural preferences without needing code changes. Here, you'll find:

- Localization Files: Language-specific files (e.g., JSON, YAML) containing translated strings and resources.

- Configuration Settings: Scripts or files to manage language preferences, locale detection, and switching.

- Integration Guides: Documentation or guides on integrating i18n features into your project.

## Purpose

The purpose of this directory is to centralize all i18n-related assets, making it easier to manage and extend language support across different components of your application.

## Getting Started

If you're new to internationalization, start with the documentation or setup guide provided here. Ensure that your development environment is configured to handle multi-language support effectively.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve language coverage, update translations, or enhance i18n features are welcome. Please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md.
